* Update app/services/importer.rb to support loading of text and number answers. Currently it 
  only creates a question if it is a single-choice or multi-choice. It should also create the
  question (and answers) if it is a text or number mode. You can get an example of the old 
  question format from cbt/trunk/subjects/cse12oop/cse12oop.xml (or similar). You need to support
  NUMBER and WORD element answer formats. For a description of how the XML api in Ruby works you 
  can look at 
  - Tutorial: http://www.germane-software.com/~ser/software/rexml/docs/tutorial.html
  - API Docs: http://www.germane-software.com/~ser/software/rexml/doc/index.html

  You run the importer something like 
  C:\Projects\napts>ruby script\runner 'Importer.import_file("CSE21ADS","cse12oop.xml")'

* (For Pete) Functional test for new and edit of question controller

* (For Pete) Functional test the importer

* students/question partial should take a local and not use an instance variable

* write the stupid test for text_formatter in lib
